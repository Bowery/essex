## Marketing
- Did you just join a company and don’t want to spend all day getting their app to work?
- We tweet about how we just set up people using it. Post it on HackerNews/PH and make a screencast.

## Interaction
You can drag and drop your application onto the page, let us know if you need anything specific (OS, versions, libraries, etc), and an email for us to let you know when we’re done installing everything on a virtual machine

## A/B Tests
- Mention that it’s a Bowery VM/Bowery Related
	* might want to keep it on the same website so it doesn’t feel like a pivot. Making Bowery even easier to use.
- Charge for it?
	* Snowflake strategy “It’s free for you, my little snowflake” (Product Hunt people get it free for a day or 2)
	* Charge upfront ($100) w/ Surge Pricing like Uber
- Mention that people are involved in the process vs all algorithmic

## Customer
**What are the problems our product solves?**
Getting code running on your computer the first time in a reproducible way takes half a day.

**Do customers perceive these problems as important or “must-have”?**
You have to get the code running somehow, but you already got it running if you work there. It’s really only relevant if there’s a new codebase… you’re starting a new job.

**If we’re selling to businesses, who in a company has a problem our product could solve?**
Software Engineers on their first day or their managers who want them to get setup quickly.

**If we are selling to consumers how do we reach them? How big is this problem?**
-> Product Hunt, Designer News, Hacker News
-> Very specific use case so that early adopters will send it to friends

**Feedback**
- Mitch: Setting it up yourself is important b/c you want to know how it all works. Does it have brew? What are the database passwords? Are we using Vagrant or Bowery | VMware or Virtual Box
